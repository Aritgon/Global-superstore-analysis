## Data Cleaning (Using pandas)
- It had **0** null values.
- It had two columns named "row_id" and "ËÆ∞ÂΩïÊï∞", which presented no real value to our analysis, so it was better to get rid of it.
- Extracted the "time-part" from both "order_date" and "ship_date" column, which also presented no real insights.

## üîç Key business metrics
- Which market has the most customers? How is the customer retention?
- how is delivery timing to orders? which country has the least delivery timing?
