## Data Cleaning (Using pandas)
- It had **0** null values.
- It had two columns named "row_id" and "ËÆ∞ÂΩïÊï∞", which presented no real value to our analysis, so it was better to get rid of it.
- Extracted the "time-part" from both "order_date" and "ship_date" column, which also presented no real insights.
 


## üîç Key business metrics
- Which market has the most customers? How is the customer retention?
- how is delivery timing to orders? which country has the least delivery timing?
- Which category has the most sales? which sub category of product sold the most? which product sold in higher quantity?
- relation between profit and discount over the years? Does giving more discount benefits the business?

**1.** _The customer base is pretty fairly distributed among APAC, EU, LATAM, US, EMEA and AFRICA. While the market in CANADA is still yet to develop. Conducting a new marketing program can be beneficial for the company._

**2.** _Also another report shows that the customer retention increased over the year while the transactions of new customers has been decreasing. This highlights a marketing issue of the company, signaling that a restructural change in its marketing is needed._

**3.** _The customer segmentation report or RFM report reveals that a majority a customer group falls under the category of "Potential Loyalist"._

RFM stands for -
- **Recency** - _how recently a customer made a transaction (calculated as the difference between the customer latest transaction date and the latest transaction date of the dataset)._
- **Frequency** - _how often a customer do transactions._
- **Monetary** - _how much a customer has spent in total value._

- _approximately 2.9k customers falls in "potential loyalist" category. There purchase history shows a pretty fair transaction gap but they aren't close to being loyal._
- _approximately 2.8k customers falls in "at risk" category. This base of customer has a gap of transaction over 120 days, highlighting a potential churn risk._

**üí°Insight**: _Both of the customer category is dominating the customer base but it also suggests a large portion of the customer base has an mid-to-high inactivity gaps. This is a critical area for engagement and major fixes, indicating the business should:_
